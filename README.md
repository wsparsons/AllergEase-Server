[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wsparsons/AllergEase-Client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wsparsons/AllergEase-Client)

## ABOUT THIS APPLICATION
AllergEase is a full-stack mobile responsive React Redux application that helps you spot allergens with ease. 

Food allergy awareness has greatly increased recently. However, grocery shopping is still complicated due to unexpected food pseudonyms and additives. Allergease provides ease of mind for people with restricted diets and the people who shop for them. 

Instead of laboring over long ingredient lists, trust Allergease to keep your loved ones healthy.

It makes shopping easier by supplementing a shopperâ€™s perusal of product ingredients with a database that provides immediate certainty.
